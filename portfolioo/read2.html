        <p class="intro-para mx-5 text-center">Spyfall is a very popular game, it is all-in-one social platform for gamers offered on various platforms- Web, Mobile, and Desktop Applications. Spyfall is probably the closest acquaintance to the physical game. Spyfall is a game that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. This game, which can be played by people of all ages, provides mental entertainment to all and enhances efficiency. The game follows very simple rules, is easy to understand and can be played very easily in a way that even a new player can understand.


            Spyfall game is most advantageous for the kids. Game rules often make things a little tricky. Students will have to put their thinking caps on and figure out a way to score points while still abiding by the rules. This will help with problem-solving skills. Spyfall also play with strategizing and planning. This will help kids to focus on what they are doing and they also have to pay attention to the moves their opponents are making.

          <p class="em1-para py-2">Like I said before, It’s one of the most enjoyable games ever played by children and adults alike. A typical game of Spyfall lasts for between 6 and 10 minutes, depending on the time control. 

            Each player receives a card representing the same location, except one player who receives a "spy" card. The spy has to guess the location, while other players have to identify the spy. On their turn, players ask each another questions, trying to lure the spy out without giving them too much information about what the location is. At any time during the game, or at its end when the timer runs out, one player can accuse another of being the spy; if there is a consensus and the spy is identified, the spy loses; otherwise, the spy wins. Additionally, at any time the spy can announce that they are the spy, and try to guess the location. If successful, the spy wins, otherwise the spy loses. This is a brief description of the game.
From this we can find the disadvantages of the game. Most people have turned to online games since the outbreak of covid19.Not only that, those who do not have the money to buy expensive cards, those who do not want to read a big rule book, those who are new to the game, those who care about the safety of children, they all want an online game.

            So, a lot of kids are withdrawing from this game and spending time on social media. To change this trend, I want to change its shortcomings and come up with a change for children to play effectively

            The Reward-like feature was made possible as an incentive for children to see a lack of interest in playing. Cards are flipped after each game. The exact score is recorded on the scoreboard
